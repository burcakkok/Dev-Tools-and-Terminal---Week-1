    <h2 id="Albums">some albums I listen over and over</h2>
    <h6>Posted on September, 2021</h6>

    <p> like many people, listening music is a big part of my daily life. while I am doing something, music plays in the background. I mean almost all the time... so I decided to share every month three albums that I love listening and make me keep pushing replay button. -drum beats- here albums of this month! </p>

      <p> <i>radiohead-in rainbows </i><br> this masterpiece has been released in 2007. personally I love all the other albums from radiohead but this one always hits me different. always makes me calm and clean my mind at that moment. maybe it will work for you too. just give it a try. it was difficult to choose but here my favourites from album;
      <ul class="songs">
        <li>nude</li>
        <li>weird fishes/arpeggi</li>
        <li>reckoner</li>
      </ul>

      <p><i>yasemin mori-hayvanlar</i> <br>
        <i>hayvanlar</i> has been released in 2008. when I first saw on the tv it catched my attention immediately. and since then every year it growth in me more and more. she was just writing however she want and makes me feel everything of human nature. still inspires and energize me. absolutely worth to try. my favourites from album;
      <ul class="songs">
        <li>aslında bir konu var</li>
        <li>kuzgun</li>
        <li>mutsuz punk</li>
      </ul>

      <p><i>büyük ev ablukada-fırtınayt</i> <br>
        the last so-called form of the band has been released in 2017. whole album reflects the feeling of most of the people; sad but in a good humor. not a surprise that the album has been announced with a concert called 'upset party'. it is not depressive but just confortable with how everything is. my favourites from album;
      <ul class="songs">
        <li>arayan bulur</li>
        <li>hoşçakal kadar</li>
        <li>hepsine ne fena</li>
      </ul>
